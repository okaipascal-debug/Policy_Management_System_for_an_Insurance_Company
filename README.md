# Policy_Management_System_for_an_Insurance_Company
## Insurance Management System
# Project Overview
A professional object-oriented Python application demonstrating insurance policy management, product cataloging, and payment processing systems. This academic project showcases proper software architecture principles with separated concerns and modular design. Thus, through building an insurance company management system where we can add customers such as policyholders, create insurance products like car insurance, health insurance etc, process payments and see who bought what

# Features
Create and manage customer profiles with comprehensive account details
Define insurance products with customizable premium calculations
Handle payment transactions with status tracking and validation
Link policyholders to specific insurance products through payment transactions

# Class Architecture
# Policyholder Class
Manages customer personal information and policy associations

Provides methods for policy management and account display

Maintains relationship between customers and their insurance products

# Product Class
Defines insurance product attributes and pricing structure

Implements premium calculation with risk-based factors

Supports product information display and management

# Payment Class
Handles payment transaction processing and validation

Tracks payment status, methods, and timestamps

Ensures payment integrity through amount validation

# Installation & Requirements
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher

No external dependencies required

# Setup
Clone or download the project files

Ensure all Python files are in the same directory
